# Tanzu-GenAI-Platform-installer

TL;DR - A powershell script that automates the install of VMware Tanzu Platform, a private PaaS which includes GenAI capabilites, on VMware vSphere with minimal resource requirements.

The installer takes minimum set of parameters, validates them, and then performs the install of the platform which includes VMware Tanzu Operations Manager, BOSH Director, Cloud Foundry runtime, VMware Postgres, and GenAI service with models that have embedding, chat, and tools capabilities. Note, the script uses what is known as the Small Footprint Tanzu Platform for Cloud Foundry which is a repackaging of Tanzu Platform for Cloud Foundry into a smaller deployment with fewer VMs which is perfect for POC and sandbox work. Note, there are some limitations with small footprint which can be found [here](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/tanzu-platform-for-cloud-foundry/10-0/tpcf/toc-tas-install-index.html#limits). For a much more comprehensive automated install of Tanzu Platform, which uses [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/), check out the [Platform Automation Toolkit for Tanzu](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/platform-automation-toolkit-for-tanzu/5-2/vmware-automation-toolkit/docs-index.html)

## Prerequisites
**VMware ESXi host/cluster (ESXi v7.x or v8.x) with the following spare capacity...**

  - Memory: ~100 GB
  - Storage: ~400 GB

**Networking**
  - IP addresses
    - A subnet with approximately 15 free IP addresses including two static IP addresses
      - 1x Tanzu Operations Manger

## Fill out required data in the script
Update each instance of "FILL-ME-IN" in the script. See below for a worked example...

Update the path to the VMware Tanzu Operations Manager (OpsMan) OVA, Tanzu Platform for Cloud Foundry (TPCF) tile, VMware Postgres tile, VMware Tanzu GenAI tile, and OM CLI
```bash
### Full Path to Tanzu Operations Manager OVA, TPCF tile, Postgres tile, GenAI tile, and OM CLI
$OpsManOVA    = "/Users/Tanzu/Downloads/ops-manager-vsphere-3.0.40+LTS-T.ova"
$TPCFTile     = "/Users/Tanzu/Downloads/srt-10.0.5-build.2.pivotal"
$PostgresTile = "/Users/Tanzu/Downloads/postgres-10.0.0-build.31.pivotal"
$GenAITile    = "/Users/Tanzu/Downloads/genai-10.0.3.pivotal"
$OMCLI        = "/usr/local/bin/om"
```

Update infra details
```bash
### Infra config
$VIServer          = "vcenter.tanzu.lab"
$VIUsername        = "administrator@tanzu.lab"
$VIPassword        = "my-super-safe-password!"
$VMDatacenter      = "Tanzu-DC"
$VMCluster         = "Tanzu-Cluster"
$VMResourcePool    = "Tanzu-Platform-RP"
$VMDatastore       = "vsanDatastore"
$VirtualSwitchType = "VSS"       
$VMNetwork         = "tp-network-70" 
$VMNetworkCIDR     = "10.0.70.0/24"  
$VMNetmask         = "255.255.255.0"
$VMGateway         = "10.0.70.1"
$VMDNS             = "10.0.70.1"
$VMNTP             = "10.0.70.1"
```

Update Tanzu Platform config
```bash
### Tanzu Platform config
$OpsManagerAdminPassword  = "my-super-safe-password!"   
$OpsManagerIPAddress      = "10.0.70.10"       
$OpsManagerFQDN           = "opsman.tanzu.lab"            
$BOSHNetworkReservedRange = "10.0.70.0-10.0.70.2,10.0.70.10"  #add IPs, either individual and/or ranges you _don't_ want BOSH to use in the subnet eg Ops Man, gateway, DNS, NTP, jumpbox
$TPCFGoRouter             = "10.0.70.100"                     #IP which the Tanzu Platform system and apps domain resolves to
$TPCFDomain               = "tp.tanzu.lab"                    #Tanzu Platform system and apps subdomains will be added to this. Resolves to the GoRouter IP
```


## Run the script
- Open a powershell console eg `pwsh`
- Execute the script eg `tanzu-genai-platform-installer.ps1`
- Installation can take up to 2.5 hours. Install time depends on the performance of your underlying infrastructure. 

- Note; if this is your first time using Powershell with the VMware PowerCLI module, you may be promted participate in the VMware CEIP. You can accept/deny so not prompted again by running `Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -Scope User -ParticipateInCEIP $true or $false`

## Next steps

### Deploy a sample app
- Retrieve UAA admin credentials
  - The script on completion will print out the admin credentials for Tanzu Apps Manager and CF CLI, alternatively, you can retrieve them via Tanzu Operations Manager > Small Footprint Tanzu Platform for Cloud Foundry > Credentials > UAA > Admin Credentials
- Create an Org and a Space using either Tanzu Apps Manager or cf CLI for where we can deploy a sample app
  - **Tanzu Apps Manager**
    - The script on completion will print out the Tanzu Apps Manager URL and credentials, alternatively, see the docs [here](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/tanzu-platform-for-cloud-foundry/10-0/tpcf/console-login.html) on how to access and use Apps Manager 
  - **CF CLI**
    -  The script on completion will print out how to download cf cli and how to run `cf login`, alternatively, see the [install docs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/tanzu-platform-for-cloud-foundry/10-0/tpcf/install-go-cli.html) and [login docs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/tanzu-platform-for-cloud-foundry/10-0/tpcf/getting-started.html)
    - Create an Org eg
      - `cf create-org tanzu-demos-org`
    - Create a Space eg
      - `cf create-space demos-space -o tanzu-demos-org`
    - Target an Org and Space eg
      - `cf target -o tanzu-demos-org -s demos-space`
- Deploy a sample app
  - Download spring-music
    - `git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music.git`
  - Build jar file
    - ```
      cd spring-music
      ./gradlew clean assemble
      ```
  - Run app
    - `cf push`
  - Verify app is running, retrieve route, and open app
    - `cf apps` 


## Troubleshooting
- An install log can be found where you run the script from with a file name of tanzu-genai-platform-installer.log. It contains verbose logging.
